## 📚 Libft

### Description
Libft is the first project at School 42 and consists of building a personal C library by recreating standard libc functions (such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `malloc`, `free`, among others) and developing additional utility functions.  
The goal is to understand the internal workings of these functions and to create a robust set of tools for use in future projects.

### Challenges and Implementation

- **Understanding Standard Functions**  
  Reimplementing common functions required a deep understanding of memory handling and low-level operations.

- **Memory Management**  
  Manual memory allocation and deallocation were crucial to avoid memory leaks.

- **Code Standardization (Norminette)**  
  Keeping the code compliant with School 42’s strict style guidelines was a constant challenge.

- **Data Structures (Bonus)**  
  In the bonus part, I implemented functions to manipulate linked lists, learning how to create, insert, delete, and iterate through nodes.

### What I Learned

- **Low-Level C Programming**  
  Mastery of C syntax and direct memory manipulation.

- **Library Structure**  
  How to organize and compile a static library for reuse.

- **Data Structures Fundamentals**  
  Implementation and manipulation of linked lists and the use of structs.

- **Good Coding Practices**  
  Adherence to coding standards and proper documentation.
